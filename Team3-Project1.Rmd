# The Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown on Robbery Incidents in Washington D.C.

## Abstract
A. Briefly introduce the topic and purpose of the study
B. Summarize the key findings and conclusions of the study
 


## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted various aspects of daily life, including crime rates. This EDA project examines the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on robbery rates in Washington D.C using a dataset of roughly 8000 observations. The study analyzes the pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-pandemic periods (2019-2022) to determine significant changes in robbery frequency. Robbery is defined by the Code of the District of Columbia as taking anything of value from the person or immediate actual possession of another by force or violence, putting in fear, or by sudden or stealthy seizure or snatching. The project explores differences in robbery patterns during the pandemic compared to pre/post-pandemic times. It also investigates changes in the relationship between the day of the week and the frequency of robberies before and after the pandemic period. Additionally, the project examines changes in the relationship between the day of the month and the frequency of robberies before and after the pandemic period. Finally, the study identifies significant changes in the frequency of robberies among districts before and after the pandemic.


The study by Boman and Gallupe (2020), suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated mandatory stay-at-home orders have had a differential impact on crime rates in the US. While overall crime rates, as measured by calls for service to law enforcement, have decreased compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, this drop appears to be driven by decreases in minor offenses that are typically committed in peer groups. In contrast, serious crimes that are generally not committed with co-offenders, such as homicide and intimate partner violence, have either remained constant or increased. The study raises the possibility that mandatory lockdown orders may have displaced minor offenders into situations where there is a greater opportunity for serious crimes, particularly intimate partner violence and homicide.


In order to understand the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on robbery rates in Washington D.C, it is important to first examine the overall crime rates in the area prior to the pandemic. According to the Metropolitan Police Department's crime statistics, the overall crime rate in Washington D.C. has been decreasing in recent years. In 2019, there were 31,700 reported incidents of crime, a decrease from 37,265 in 2016. However, within this overall trend, there have been fluctuations in specific types of crimes, including robbery. Moreover, Robbery has been a persistent problem in Washington D.C., particularly in certain areas of the city. In 2019, there were 2,700 reported incidents of robbery, down from 2,977 in 2015. As such, it is important to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures have impacted robbery rates in the city. This analysis will provide insight into how the pandemic has affected crime patterns in a major urban area and may inform future policy decisions related to crime prevention and public safety.

## Methodology

### 1. Data  
In the opening section of this report, we provide a comprehensive overview of the data used in our analysis. <<<We obtained our data from the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington D.C., and specifically focused on the Crime Incidents dataset.

The dataset contains detailed information on robbery incidents that occurred between 2019 and 2022, and we extracted this information into our dataset titled "Robbery_DC_clean.csv".

In this section, we will provide a commentary on the data, highlighting its strengths and limitations. This information is critical in providing context for the analysis and understanding the potential impact of any data-related issues on the conclusions drawn from our analysis.

Furthermore, we will discuss the data cleaning and preprocessing steps taken to ensure that the data is suitable for analysis. These steps include removing duplicate records, addressing missing values, and identifying and handling outliers.

We will also provide an overview of the variables included in the dataset, such as the date and time of the robbery incident, the location of the incident, the method used, and other relevant details. This information is essential in developing a comprehensive understanding of the robbery incidents and their potential relationship to the COVID-19 lockdown.

Overall, this section provides a solid foundation for the analysis that follows, and we have taken great care to ensure that the data is reliable, relevant, and suitable for our analysis.


### 2. Data Wrangling and Preprocessing

```{r}
#Import
Robbery = data.frame(read.csv("Robbery_DC_clean.csv"))

#Import
#str(Robbery)  
```



This section typically involves importing, cleaning, and pre-processing raw data to prepare it for analysis. The data cleaning process include removing duplicate records, addressing missing values, identifying and handling outliers, and transforming variables as needed. By performing these steps, we can ensure that the data is suitable for analysis and that our conclusions are based on accurate and reliable information. In this section, we will provide an overview of the data wrangling and pre-processing steps taken for the "Robbery_DC_clean.csv" dataset used in our analysis.

## Analysis 


### 1. Summary statistics

In this section, we provide a detailed overview of the summary statistics of some quantitative datas in our data set. This information includes measures such as the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

We will also examine other measures, such as the interquartile range (IQR) and coefficient of variation, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data's variability and dispersion.

By analyzing the summary statistics, we can identify any significant trends or patterns in the data, such as the overall frequency of robbery incidents, the distribution of robbery incidents across different days of the week or months, and the most common methods used in robbery incidents.

We will also provide a commentary on the summary statistics, highlighting any notable findings or trends that may impact the analysis of the data. This analysis will help to identify potential issues or areas of interest that require further investigation in subsequent sections of the report.

Overall, the summary statistics provide a critical foundation for the analysis of the robbery data, enabling us to develop a more accurate and detailed understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on robbery rates in Washington D.C.

Based on the summary statistics of the robbery data between 2019 to 2022 in D.C., we can observe the following:

There were a total of 8,343 robbery incidents during the period, with 2,535 incidents recorded in the pre-lockdown period and 3,079 incidents in the post-lockdown period.
The robbery incidents were evenly distributed across different seasons, with the highest number of incidents recorded in the spring (1,585) and the lowest in winter (2,073).
The majority of robbery incidents occurred during the evening shift (3,305) and midnight shift (3,381), with very few incidents during the day shift (1,657).
The most common method used in robbery incidents was with a gun (4,031 incidents), followed by other methods (3,804 incidents) and with a knife (508 incidents).
The districts with the highest number of robbery incidents were 4 (1,379 incidents), 7 (1,224 incidents), and 6 (1,163 incidents), while the PSA with the highest number of incidents was PSA 708 (599 incidents).
The mean clearance rate for robbery incidents was 9.73%, which indicates that only a small percentage of cases resulted in an arrest or closure.
There were some missing values in the data set, with 1701 instances of "NA" recorded in the "Day_cat" column, and 21 and 22 instances of "NA" recorded in the "METHOD" and "PSA" columns, respectively.
Overall, the summary statistics provide a helpful overview of the robbery data, highlighting the key trends and patterns that can inform subsequent analysis.

### 2. : Exploratory plots of robbery incidents in D.C. before and during the COVID-19 lockdown

 This section presents a set of draft plots that visually illustrate the trends and patterns of robbery incidents in Washington D.C. before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The plots include histograms, scattorplots, and boxplots that display the frequency of robbery incidents across different time periods, days of the week, and locations in the city. The plots also highlight any significant changes or fluctuations in the robbery rates during the lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period.
 
Period_cat | Define | Description   
-----|-------|-----------  
 Pre   | Pre-pandemic (14M)   |  2019.1.1 ~2020.2.29   
Lock   | Lockdown(17M)   | 2020.3.1~ 2021. 7.31    
Post   |   Post-pandemic(17M)   | 2021.8.1~2022.12.31 

The table above shows a categorization of time periods based on the events related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The periods are defined as Pre, Lock, and Post.

The first period, Pre, refers to the time before the pandemic had a significant impact on society, ranging from January 1st, 2019 to February 29th, 2020. During this time, people were living their lives as usual, with no significant disruptions caused by the pandemic.

The second period, Lock, refers to the time when During the lockdown period in the District of Columbia (Lock period), the government implemented several measures to curb the spread of the virus, including banning gatherings of 50 or more people, cutting restaurant dining room capacity in half, disallowing bar and standing service for social distancing, and closing nightclubs. This period lasted from March 1st, 2020 to July 31st, 2021, lasting for 17 months. During this time, people were confined to their homes, and many businesses were closed, resulting in a significant impact on daily life.

The third period, Post, refers to the time after the lockdown measures were lifted, from August 1st, 2021 to December 31st, 2022, lasting for 17 months. During this period, people were slowly returning to their daily routines, with businesses reopening, and social interactions resuming to some degree. However, there was still a need to take precautions, such as wearing masks, and social distancing, due to the continued threat of the pandemic.

Overall, this categorization of time periods based on the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the significant impact the pandemic has had on daily life, and how the world has adapted to cope with the challenges posed by the virus.

```

The histograms A1~A2 shows the distribution of data over four years (2019-2022) and 12 months within each year. The vertical axis represents the count of data points while the horizontal axis represents the years and months.

Overall, the data seems to show an increasing trend over the years, with the highest count in 2022. Within each year, there are variations in the count of data points, with the highest count in October and the lowest count in March for each year.

The percent column shows the percentage of data points for each month in relation to the total count of data points. The highest percentage of data points is in October with 11%, followed by September and July with 10% each. The lowest percentage of data points is in March with 6%, followed by February and April with 7% each.

This histogram could be used to identify trends and patterns in the data, as well as to determine which months have the most and least data points.

Based on the provided data, A3 and A4 show the frequency of robbery incidents split by pandemic phases. The pandemic phases are divided into three categories, which are pre-pandemic, lock-down, and post-pandemic.

A3 shows the number of robbery incidents that occurred during each of the pandemic phases. The pre-pandemic phase had 2535 robbery incidents, the lock-down phase had 2729 robbery incidents, and the post-pandemic phase had 3079 robbery incidents.

A4 shows the average number of robbery incidents per month during each pandemic phase. The pre-pandemic phase had an average of 181 robbery incidents per month, the lock-down phase had an average of 160 robbery incidents per month, and the post-pandemic phase had an average of 181 robbery incidents per month.

Overall, the data shows that there was an increase in the number of robbery incidents during the lock-down phase compared to the pre-pandemic phase. However, the number of robbery incidents during the post-pandemic phase was higher than both the pre-pandemic and lock-down phases. The average number of robbery incidents per month remained relatively stable during the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic phases, but decreased during the lock-down phase.

This histograms shows the monthly robbery frequency during three different periods: pre-pandemic (A2-2), lockdown (A2-3), and post-pandemic (A2-4). The pre-pandemic period covers 14 months from January 2019 to February 2020. The lockdown period covers 17 months from March 2020 to July 2021. The post-pandemic period covers 17 months from August 2021 to December 2022.

Looking at the histograms, the monthly robbery frequency during the pre-pandemic period ranged from 126 to 230 incidents, with an average of 181 incidents per month. During the lockdown period, the monthly robbery frequency ranged from 87 to 258 incidents, with an average of 160 incidents per month. Finally, during the post-pandemic period, the monthly robbery frequency ranged from 131 to 260 incidents, with an average of 181 incidents per month.

The bar charts (A2-5, A2-6, A2-7, A2-8) display the number of robberies per month and year, with the x-axis representing the months  and the y-axis representing the frequency of robberies. These charts provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns in robbery incidents over a four-year period.

In 2019, the number of robberies increased from January to October, with the highest number of robberies occurring in October at 230. The number of robberies then decreased in the following months of the year. In 2020, the number of robberies remained relatively stable until August, after which it began to increase, peaking in October at 258. In 2021, the number of robberies continued to rise from August to October, with the highest number of robberies occurring in October at 220. The number of robberies decreased in November and December of the same year.

Overall, the bar charts reveal an increasing trend in the number of robberies from 2019 to 2020, with October being the peak month for both years. Although the number of robberies decreased in 2021, it still remained relatively high compared to the beginning of the time period. These bar charts are useful for identifying patterns and making comparisons between different months and years, which can help in understanding the overall trend in robbery incidents.

Based on the provided data, Chart B1 shows the average number of robberies per month in each season. Spring and winter have the lowest average number of robberies, with 132 and 172 respectively, while summer and autumn have the highest averages, with 186 and 2054 respectively.

Chart B1_1 shows the average number of robberies per month in each season before the pandemic. The pattern is similar to Chart B1, with summer and autumn having the highest averages, but with slightly higher numbers overall. Spring and winter also have slightly higher averages, with 156 and 154 respectively.

Chart B1_2 shows the average number of robberies per month in each season during the lockdown period. Interestingly, the number of robberies decreased significantly in spring and summer, with averages of 110 and 183 respectively. However, the number of robberies dramatically increased again in autumn, with an average of 221, and remained high in winter with an average of 160.

Chart B1_3 shows the average number of robberies per month in each season after the lockdown period. The number of robberies in summer decreased slightly to an average of 168, while the number of robberies in autumn remained high at an average of 189. The number of robberies in spring increased to an average of 150, while the number of robberies in winter increased significantly to an average of 205.

Overall, the data suggests that the pandemic had a significant impact on the number of robberies, with a decrease during the lockdown period and a subsequent increase afterward. The patterns of each season are generally consistent throughout the time period, with summer and autumn having the highest averages.

Based on the provided data, we can see that the average number of robberies per month varied by season and was affected by the pandemic. In chart B1_2, which represents the lockdown period, the number of robberies decreased in the beginning of the lockdown during spring and summer but dramatically increased again from autumn and continued to increase after the lockdown was lifted. The pattern of post-pandemic (summer and winter) is also interesting.

Looking at the data in more detail, we see that the average number of robberies per month was highest in autumn across all years (2019-2022), with an average of 2054 in chart B1. In chart B1_1, which represents the pre-pandemic period, the average number of robberies per month was highest in autumn with an average of 216. In chart B1_3, which represents the post-pandemic period, the average number of robberies per month was highest in winter with an average of 205.

Furthermore, we can see that there were fluctuations in the average number of robberies per month across the different seasons and years. For example, in chart B1_5, which represents the 2019 data, the average number of robberies per month was highest in summer with a total of 645, while in chart B1_6, which represents the 2020 data, the average number of robberies per month was highest in autumn with a total of 665. In chart B1_7, which represents the 2021 data, the average number of robberies per month was highest in summer with a total of 572, while in chart B1_8, which represents the 2022 data, the average number of robberies per month was highest in winter with a total of 639.

Overall, the data suggests that the pandemic had a significant impact on the average number of robberies per month, particularly during the lockdown period. However, it's important to note that there were also fluctuations in the data across different seasons and years, indicating that other factors may also be contributing to the frequency of robberies.


**4-1. Freq by Date_cat(Begin,Middle,End) :split by pandemic phrases**

In this analysis, the number of robberies is split by date categories: begin, middle, and end of each month. The data is also split by pandemic phrases, to examine any potential impact of the pandemic on robbery frequency.

```

The chart C1 shows the number of robbery incidents based on the date category. The data is split into three categories: Begin, Middle, and End.

From the chart, we can see that the highest number of robbery incidents occurred during the End category, followed by the Middle category and the Begin category.

The data is further split into three pandemic phases: Pre-pandemic, Lockdown, and Post-pandemic. Interestingly, the number of robbery incidents decreased during the Pre-pandemic phase in all three date categories. During the Lockdown phase, the number of robbery incidents increased compared to the Pre-pandemic phase, but it remained relatively stable during the Post-pandemic phase.

Overall, it seems that the pandemic did have an impact on robbery incidents, with a decrease during the Pre-pandemic phase and an increase during the Lockdown phase. However, it is also important to note that robbery incidents increased again during the Post-pandemic phase, indicating that the impact of the pandemic may not be permanent.

boxplot_Date 
```


The boxplot shows the distribution of robbery incidents across three different time periods: pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-pandemic. The median robbery date for each period is represented by the horizontal line within each box, while the lower and upper boundaries of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively.

Looking at the plot, we can see that the distribution of robbery incidents is relatively similar across the different periods. The boxes for each period have similar widths and heights, indicating similar variability and spread of the data within each period.

However, there are some differences in the medians and lower/upper boundaries for each period. For example, the median robbery date for the pre-pandemic period (around June 15th) appears to be slightly earlier than that for the lockdown period (around June 20th), and both of these are earlier than the median date for the post-pandemic period (around June 23rd).

Additionally, the range of robbery dates appears to be slightly wider for the post-pandemic period, with more outliers falling outside the upper boundary of the box compared to the other periods. This suggests that there may have been more variability in the timing of robbery incidents during the post-pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic and lockdown periodsx-axis represents the different periods.


**5-1. Freq by SHIFT(DAY,EVENING,MIDNIGHT) :split by pandemic phrases**

This section examines the frequency of robberies during different shifts of the day: Day, Evening, and Midnight. The data is categorized based on three pandemic phases: Pre-pandemic, Lockdown, and Post-pandemic. The analysis is based on the count of robberies, rather than the average number of robberies per month. This analysis provides insight into the impact of pandemic phases on the occurrence of robberies at various times of the day.

This charts shows (D1) the distribution of robbery incidents based on the time of day they occurred, separated by pandemic phases. The three time categories are Day, Evening, and Midnight. The highest number of robberies occurred during the Midnight shift, with 1173 incidents reported at the end of the robbery, followed by 1027 incidents in the Middle and 879 in the Begin.

Overall, the number of robberies was highest during the Midnight shift, with 3381 incidents reported, followed by 3305 in the Evening and 1657 during the Day shift. During the Pre-pandemic phase, the highest number of robberies occurred during the Midnight shift, with 1044 incidents, while in the Lockdown phase, the Evening shift had the highest number of robberies, with 1054 incidents. In the Post-pandemic phase, the Evening shift had the highest number of robberies, with 1226 incidents reported.

This analysis can help in identifying the high-risk periods for robbery and can assist law enforcement agencies in allocating resources to ensure public safety. It can also help in understanding the impact of pandemic phases on the incidence of robbery at different times of the day.

The analysis of the data shows that during the day time, the percentage of robberies was consistent at around 20% across all three periods: pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-pandemic. However, in the evening and midnight time periods, the percentage of robberies was consistently higher, at almost 40% for each period.

Looking at the pre-pandemic period specifically, the percentage of robberies that occurred in the evening time period was approximately 38%, which increased slightly to 40% in the post-pandemic period. The percentage of robberies that occurred in the midnight time period remained relatively constant, at approximately 42% in the pre-pandemic and lockdown periods, but decreased to 38% in the post-pandemic period.


**5-2. Boxplot distribution of Time_hour(00:00~24:00) :split by pandemic phrases**

The boxplot distribution of time_hour split by pandemic phases provides an insight into the distribution of the time of the day when the robbery incidents occurred in different pandemic periods.

**6-1. Freq by Day_cat (Sun~Sat) :split by pandemic phrases**
 
This section presents a frequency analysis of robbery incidents by day of the week, split by pandemic phases. The days of the week are categorized as Sunday to Saturday. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there were any changes in the frequency of robbery incidents on specific days of the week during the pandemic phases.

```


These four histograms show the frequency of robberies that occurred on each day of the week during different periods: overall, pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-pandemic.

Looking at the overall histogram, we can see that Sunday had the highest frequency of robberies, with 1326 incidents reported, while Thursday had the lowest frequency, with only 1112 incidents reported. The remaining days had frequencies that were relatively close to each other.

In the pre-pandemic period, the frequency of robberies was lower compared to the overall period, and the distribution among the days of the week was more even, with Sunday having the highest frequency of 391 incidents, and Tuesday having the lowest frequency of 330 incidents.

During the lockdown period, the frequency of robberies increased compared to the pre-pandemic period, with Sunday still having the highest frequency of 450 incidents, and Thursday having the lowest frequency of 344 incidents.

In the post-pandemic period, the frequency of robberies continued to increase compared to the previous period, with Tuesday having the highest frequency of 457 incidents and Thursday having the lowest frequency of 420 incidents. Sunday remained one of the days with a high frequency of robberies, with 485 incidents reported.

Overall, these histograms show that the frequency of robberies varied among different days of the week and different periods. It is interesting to note that the frequency of robberies increased during the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period, which may suggest a link between the pandemic and an increase in criminal activity. 


**7-1. Freq by Day_cat_2 (Week,Weekend) :split by pandemic phrases**

The section 7-1 shows the frequency of robberies based on two categories: weekdays and weekends. The data is also split by pandemic phrases: pre, lock, and post.

  + Portion of Weekend (Pre-Lock-Post): 31.01%	32.25%	31.21%

```


The histograms  show the frequency of robberies on weekdays and weekends in different periods. In the overall period, there were more robberies on weekdays than on weekends, with 5716 incidents on weekdays and 2627 on weekends.

In the pre-pandemic period, the pattern was similar, with 1749 incidents on weekdays and 786 on weekends. During the lockdown period, there was an increase in the frequency of robberies on both weekdays and weekends, with 1849 incidents on weekdays and 880 on weekends. In the post-pandemic period, the frequency of robberies on weekdays continued to increase to 2118 incidents, while the frequency on weekends increased to 961 incidents.

Overall, the histograms suggest that the pandemic did not have a significant impact on the pattern of robberies on weekdays and weekends. However, there was an overall increase in the frequency of robberies during the lockdown period, which persisted in the post-pandemic period.

**8-1. Freq by METHOD :split by pandemic phrases**

This section presents the frequency of robbery incidents by method, split by pandemic phases. The data show that the portion of gun robberies increased significantly from 34.24% in the pre-pandemic period to 51.67% in the lockdown period and further to 56.93% in the post-pandemic period. This suggests that the use of guns in robberies increased during the pandemic phases.

Additionally, the average frequency of gun robberies per month also increased from 62 in the pre-pandemic period to 83 (a 34% increase) in the lockdown period, and further to 103 (a 24% increase) in the post-pandemic period. This increase in frequency is consistent with the increase in the portion of gun robberies and further indicates the growing trend of gun use in robbery incidents.

The histograms show the frequency of robberies by weapon type, separated by pandemic period. In the overall period, the most common weapon used in robberies was "OTHERS," with 3804 incidents, followed by "GUN" with 4031 incidents, and "KNIFE" with 508 incidents.

Looking at the pre-pandemic period, the most common weapon used was "OTHERS," with 1485 incidents, followed by "GUN" with 868 incidents, and "KNIFE" with 182 incidents. In the lockdown period, the most common weapon used was again "OTHERS," with 1150 incidents, followed by "GUN" with 1410 incidents, and "KNIFE" with 169 incidents. In the post-pandemic period, the most common weapon used was "GUN," with 1753 incidents, followed by "OTHERS" with 1169 incidents, and "KNIFE" with 157 incidents.

Overall, the use of guns in robberies increased from the pre-pandemic period to the lockdown period, and then continued to increase in the post-pandemic period. Additionally, the use of knives remained relatively constant throughout the three periods.

**9-1. Freq by DISTRICT :split by pandemic phrases**

The section presents the frequency of robbery incidents by district, split by pandemic phrases: pre-lock-post. The data reveals that during lockdown, robbery incidents significantly decreased in DISTRICT2 and 3 compared to pre-pandemic and post-pandemic times. However, robbery incidents increased in DISTRICT5-7 during the same period. Furthermore, the portion of robbery incidents in DISTRICT6 showed a significant increase during the lockdown, but it decreased slightly post-pandemic. On the other hand, the portion of robbery incidents in DISTRICT5 increased consistently across all three periods. Finally, the portion of robbery incidents in DISTRICT7 increased during lockdown but decreased in the post-pandemic period.

These results could help law enforcement agencies to allocate their resources more effectively by focusing more on the high-risk areas (districts 5-7), especially during the pandemic times. It could also suggest that there may be underlying socio-economic factors contributing to the increase in robbery incidents in these districts during the lockdown. Overall, the data reveals some interesting patterns that could inform policymakers and law enforcement agencies to make data-driven decisions in preventing and addressing robbery incidents in different districts of the city.

```



From the histograms, we can see the distribution of robbery incidents across the different districts in the city, and how they changed over time, with data available for pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods.

Looking at the first histogram, we can see that District 3 had the highest number of robbery incidents overall, followed by District 6, while District 2 had the lowest number of incidents.

However, when we compare the three histograms, we can see some interesting changes over time. During the lockdown period, there was a decrease in robbery incidents across most districts, except for Districts 5-7, where incidents actually increased.

Looking at the changes in the number of incidents for each district, we can see that District 1 had the biggest increase in incidents between the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown periods, while District 3 had the smallest increase. Districts 4 and 6 had the biggest increase in incidents during the lockdown period, while District 2 had the smallest increase.

Overall, the histograms suggest that there were some changes in the patterns of robbery incidents across different districts over time, with some districts experiencing more dramatic changes than others.



**10-1. Boxplot distribution of PSA :split by pandemic phrases**

The boxplot distribution of PSA (Police Service Area) is split by pandemic phrases and shows the median, quartiles, and outliers of the PSA values. The plot suggests that during the pandemic, the median PSA values remained relatively stable, with only a slight decrease in the post-lock phase. However, the plot also shows a significant increase in outliers during the lockdown and post-lock phases, indicating a higher variability in the data. In particular, the plot highlights a steep increase in the PSA values for districts 5-7 during the pandemic.

```{r}
boxplot_PSA <- ggplot(Robbery, aes(y=PSA, x=Period_cat, fill=Period_cat)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_boxplot( colour=c("#ff0000","#11cc11","#0000ff"), outlier.shape=8,
                outlier.colour="lightblue", outlier.size=4) +  labs(title="I_1. Box Plot of Robbery by Location(PSA)", x="Period", y = "Location (PSA) of Robbery")

boxplot_PSA
```

**10-2. Boxplot distribution of Clearance rate :split by pandemic phrases**

This section presents a boxplot distribution of clearance rate of robbery events, split by pandemic phrases. The plot shows that during the lock-down period, the number of outliers (i.e., data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data) increased, indicating a higher variance in clearance rates. Additionally, high clearance rates, which indicate that it took more time to complete the robbery event, were observed across all pandemic periods. This may imply that the robbery events during these periods were more severe or challenging, or that there were inefficiencies in police administration.

```{r}
boxplot_Clearance <- ggplot(Robbery, aes(y=Clearance_rate, x=Period_cat, fill=Period_cat)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_boxplot( colour=c("#ff0000","#11cc11","#0000ff"), outlier.shape=8,
                outlier.colour="lightblue", outlier.size=4) +  labs(title="I_2. Box Plot of Robbery Clearance rate", x="Period", y = "Clearance_rate(Minute)")

boxplot_Clearance
```


### 3. Unusual Observations: Data Quality

In the "Unusual Observations" section, we will provide an in-depth analysis of the data, including a quick overview of the data with and without the outliers. Outliers can significantly impact the analysis of data and can skew the results. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and examine them closely to determine their impact on the data.By examining the data with and without the outliers, we can gain a clearer picture of the trends and patterns in the data. This information will be critical in developing an accurate and reliable analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on robbery rates in Washington D.C.


**Data Quality**
To ensure data quality, we will perform the outlierKD function to detect any null values or outliers in our dataset. Once identified, we will remove them to ensure accurate analysis(Hypothesis testing). We will then display the cleaned data using a plot to visualize any trends or patterns in the data.

`OBJECTID` : there are no outliers 

```{r}
Robbery_clean = outlierKD2(Robbery, OBJECTID, rm = TRUE, boxplt = TRUE, qqplt = TRUE)
 
```

Continue to perform test for another continuous variables. 

 + Variables that have Fixed interval like `Date`, `Time_hour` don't need test     
   So Just do that about two variables `Clearance_rate` and `PSA`

`PSA` : there are no outliers

```{r}

Robbery_clean = outlierKD2(Robbery, PSA, rm = TRUE, boxplt = TRUE, qqplt = TRUE)

```   
The distribution of Clearance_rate is highly spread-wide, suggesting the presence of outliers. To address this, we have converted outliers with high Clearance_rate to NA, which accounts for 4.8% of the data. We will use both the original data and the outlier-excluded data to ensure a comprehensive analysis.


```{r}
Robbery_clean = outlierKD2(Robbery, Clearance_rate, rm = TRUE, boxplt = TRUE, qqplt = TRUE)
#str(Robbery_clean)
```
After examining the data using the outlierKD function, we have identified outliers that have been replaced with NAs. However, we have not deleted these outliers from the dataset. Instead, we have replaced them with NAs to ensure that they do not affect the analysis of the data. This approach allows us to retain the maximum amount of data while still removing any data points that may negatively impact our analysis


### Optional analysis(For subset data have high clearance_rate)

FOr example, looking through the obs that have long clearance rate (over 200 min). Interesting thing is distict 3,7. (let's talk about that at the meeting!)

```{r}
#Clearance_rate

temp <- subset(Robbery,subset = Robbery$Clearance_rate > 200) 
str(temp)  #361


```

```{r}
temp %>%  #Freq of Char
  count(Period_cat)

temp %>%  
  count(Date_cat)

temp %>%  
  count(Day_cat_2)

temp %>%  
  count(SHIFT)

temp %>%  
  count(METHOD)

temp %>%  
  count(DISTRICT)

#temp %>%  
#  count(PSA)


```

## Hypothesis test 1- Anova test

Hypothesis test aims to Find a statistical evidence if there is significant difference between three phases, in terms of **<u> robbery pattern of pre-pandemic, lock-down, and post-pandemic.</u> **) 

 + ANOVA: compare means among different groups 
 + Chi square: compare frequencies and proportions among different groups 

By specifying robbery pattern, We set up 5 tests as belows.
level of significance standard $\alpha$ = 0.05 (The 95% confidence level

### 1. Daily robbery frequency (Quantitative var)

**(A) Anova test**

  +  Null hypothesis: $H_0:$ The Washington DC has same mean of daily robbery frequency in `pre-pandemic`,`lock-down`, and `post-pandemic` phases.

  +  Alternative hypothesis: $H_1:$ The mean daily robbery frequency of three phases are NOT all the same
  
```{r,results='hide'}
str(Robbery_date_sum)
count(Robbery_date_sum,Period_cat_num)
```


```{r}
anova_dayily_rob = aov(n~Period_cat, data = Robbery_date_sum)

anova_summary = summary(anova_dayily_rob)
#anova_summary
xkabledply(anova_dayily_rob)

#FYI. we can use Period_cat_num after Transforming as factor for analysis
#Robbery_date_sum$Period_cat_num<- as.factor(Robbery_date_sum$Period_cat_num)

#anova_dayily_rob = aov(n~Period_cat_num, data = Robbery_date_sum)
#anova_summary = summary(anova_dayily_rob)
#anova_summary

```
  + F value of the test is **7.19.**
  + The p-value is **`r anova_summary[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][[1]]`**, which is < $\alpha$ (0.05), right-tailed for one-way ANOVA.
  + **The data present is enough evidence to reject $H_0$ at the set significance level. **


**(B) Post-hoc Tukey HSD**

  + we use tukeyHSD to pursue to find out which pairs (of phases) are different.
  

```{r}
tukey_anova_dayily_rob <- TukeyHSD(anova_dayily_rob)
tukey_anova_dayily_rob
#xkabledply(tukey_anova_dayily_rob)
```
  +  `pre-pandemic`and`lock-down` are pairwise considered having different means.
  
  + Also, `post-pandemic` and`lock-down` are pairwise considered having different means. 
  
  + On the other hand,  `pre-pandemic`and`post-pandemic` are not significant at 0.05 level.

**(C) Exclude outlier**

  + We thought that outliers would affect the result, so decided to test again after excluding outliers. 5.5% of entire data was converted to NA.  

```{r}
Robbery_date_sum_exc = outlierKD2(Robbery_date_sum, n, rm = TRUE, boxplt = TRUE, qqplt = TRUE)
```
```{r}
anova_dayily_rob_exc = aov(n~Period_cat, data = Robbery_date_sum_exc)

anova_summary_exc = summary(anova_dayily_rob_exc)
#anova_summary_exc
xkabledply(anova_summary_exc)
```

```{r}
tukey_anova_dayily_rob_exc <- TukeyHSD(anova_dayily_rob_exc)
tukey_anova_dayily_rob_exc
#xkabledply(tukey_anova_dayily_rob_exc)
```  

  + The test result is same as the previous test(including outliers)


### 2. Monthly robbery frequency (Quantitative var)

**(A) Anova test**

  +  Null hypothesis: $H_0:$ The Washington DC has same mean of monthly robbery frequency in `pre-pandemic`,`lock-down`, and `post-pandemic` phases.

  +  Alternative hypothesis: $H_1:$ The mean monthly robbery frequency of three phases are NOT all the same
  
```{r,results='hide'}
str(Robbery_month_sum)
count(Robbery_month_sum,Period_cat)
```


```{r}
anova_monthly_rob = aov(n~Period_cat, data = Robbery_month_sum)
anova_summary = summary(anova_monthly_rob)
#anova_summary
xkabledply(anova_dayily_rob)
```
  + F value of the test is **1.5.**
  + The p-value is **`r anova_summary[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][[1]]`**, which is > $\alpha$ (0.05), right-tailed for one-way ANOVA.
  + **So we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at the set significance level. **

 + We thought whether outliers would affect the result, however, result was same.

```{r, results='hide'}
temp = outlierKD2(Robbery_month_sum, n, rm = TRUE, boxplt = TRUE, qqplt = TRUE)
temp = aov(n~Period_cat, data = temp)
temp = summary(temp)
temp
```

### 3. Daily robbery average time hour (Quantitative var)

  + Outliers of `Clearance_rate` has been excluded.
  
**(A) Anova test**

```{r, results='hide'}
#make a summary table
Robbery_avg_time <-  Robbery_clean %>% group_by(Period_cat, REPORT_DAT_2) %>%
                   summarise(avg_Time_hour = mean(Time_hour, na.rm = TRUE),.groups = 'drop')

arrange(Robbery_avg_time, Period_cat,REPORT_DAT_2) 

Robbery_avg_time <- data.frame(Robbery_avg_time)
```

```{r}
anova_daily_rob = aov(avg_Time_hour~Period_cat, data = Robbery_avg_time)
anova_summary = summary(anova_daily_rob)
anova_summary
#xkabledply(anova_daily_rob)
```
  + **We fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at the set significance level. **


### 4. Daily robbery average time of clr (Quantitative var)

  + Outliers of `Clearance_rate` has been excluded.
  
**(A) Anova test**

```{r, results='hide'}
#make a summary table
Robbery_avg_clr <-  Robbery_clean %>% group_by(Period_cat, REPORT_DAT_2) %>%
                   summarise(avg_Clearance_rate = mean(Clearance_rate, na.rm = TRUE),.groups = 'drop')

arrange(Robbery_avg_clr, Period_cat,REPORT_DAT_2) 

Robbery_avg_clr <- data.frame(Robbery_avg_clr)
```


```{r}
anova_daily_rob = aov(avg_Clearance_rate~Period_cat, data = Robbery_avg_clr)

anova_summary = summary(anova_daily_rob)
anova_summary
#xkabledply(anova_daily_rob)
```
  + F value of the test is **7.34.**

  + The p-value is **`r anova_summary[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][[1]]`**, which is < $\alpha$ (0.05), right-tailed for one-way ANOVA.
  
  + **So, The data present is enough evidence to reject $H_0$ at the set significance level. **

**(B) Post-hoc Tukey HSD**

  + we use tukeyHSD to pursue to find out which pairs (of phases) are different.
  

```{r}
tukey_anova_dayily_rob <- TukeyHSD(anova_daily_rob)
tukey_anova_dayily_rob
#xkabledply(tukey_anova_dayily_rob)
```

  +  `pre-pandemic`and`lock-down` are pairwise considered having different means.
  
  + Also, `post-pandemic` and`lock-down` are pairwise considered having different means. 
  
  + On the other hand,  `pre-pandemic`and`post-pandemic` are not significant at 0.05 level.


## Hypothesis test 2- Chi square test(GOF)

  + Even though frequency of robbery would not same by pandemic phrases, the pattern of incident would be same or not. 
  
  + So we conducted Chi square test to compare proportions of a few categorical values among three phrase groups.
  
  + Basically, we guess the `pre-pandemic` is the expected frequencies, and conducted test to the `lock-down`, and `post-pandemic` phases.

### 1.Robbery incident pattern by date (Categorical var)**

  +  Null hypothesis: $H_0:$ The robbery distribution of `pre-pandemic` phase  by the beginning, middle, and end of the month matches `lock-down`phases.

  +  Alternative hypothesis: $H_1:$ They do not match
  
```{r}
temp <- count(Robbery_lock,Date_cat)
value = c(Begin=temp[1,2], End=temp[2,2], Middle=temp[3,2])  

temp <- count(Robbery_pre,Date_cat)
exp_freq = c(temp[1,2]/2535, temp[2,2]/2535,temp[3,2]/2535) 

# Next perform chi-square test
chigoodness = chisq.test(value, p = exp_freq) # p stands for proportions
# look at the result
chigoodness
```
```{r}
xkabledply( as.table(chigoodness$expected), title = "Expected frequencies", wide = T)
```

$\chi^2$ value of the test is `r chigoodness$statistic`, and  p-value is `r chigoodness$p.value`. 

  + **So we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at the set significance level. **

  + At the test of comparing `pre-pandemic` and `post-pandemic`phase, the result is same.(fail to reject $H_0$)

```{r}
temp <- count(Robbery_post,Date_cat)
value = c(Begin=temp[1,2], End=temp[2,2], Middle=temp[3,2])  

temp <- count(Robbery_pre,Date_cat)
exp_freq = c(temp[1,2]/2535, temp[2,2]/2535,temp[3,2]/2535) 

# Next perform chi-square test
chigoodness = chisq.test(value, p = exp_freq) # p stands for proportions
# look at the result
chigoodness
```

### 2.Robbery incident pattern by timezone (Categorical var)**

   + **[Lock vs Pre]**

```{r}
temp <- count(Robbery_lock,SHIFT)
value = c(DAY=temp[1,2], EVENING=temp[2,2], MIDNIGHT=temp[3,2])  

temp <- count(Robbery_pre,SHIFT)
exp_freq = c(temp[1,2]/2535, temp[2,2]/2535,temp[3,2]/2535) 

# Next perform chi-square test
chigoodness = chisq.test(value, p = exp_freq) # p stands for proportions
# look at the result
chigoodness

```

   + **[Post vs Pre] The data present is enough evidence to reject $H_0$ at the set significance level. **

```{r}
temp <- count(Robbery_post,SHIFT)
value = c(DAY=temp[1,2], EVENING=temp[2,2], MIDNIGHT=temp[3,2])  

temp <- count(Robbery_pre,SHIFT)
exp_freq = c(temp[1,2]/2535, temp[2,2]/2535,temp[3,2]/2535) 

# Next perform chi-square test
chigoodness = chisq.test(value, p = exp_freq) # p stands for proportions
# look at the result
chigoodness

```

### 3.Robbery incident pattern by robbery methods (Categorical var)**

   + **[Lock vs Pre] The data present is enough evidence to reject $H_0$ at the set significance level.**
   
```{r}
temp <- count(Robbery_lock,METHOD)
value = c(GUN=temp[1,2], KNIFE=temp[2,2], OTHERS=temp[3,2])  

temp <- count(Robbery_pre,METHOD)
exp_freq = c(temp[1,2]/2535, temp[2,2]/2535,temp[3,2]/2535)

# Next perform chi-square test
chigoodness = chisq.test(value, p = exp_freq) # p stands for proportions
# look at the result
chigoodness

```

   + **[Post vs Lock] The data present is enough evidence to reject $H_0$ at the set significance level. **

```{r}
temp <- count(Robbery_post,METHOD)

**Chi-squared Test (the draft, ignore ignore ignore, need more work with this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
```{r}
table2 = table(Robbery$Period_cat, Robbery$Season)
xkabledply(table2, title="Contingency table 2'")
chitest2 = chisq.test(table2)
chitest2
```
The p-value is significantly less than 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis (the season and period_category are independent), we have evidence to support the 
Alternative hypothesis that they are not independent under the 95% confidence level. 
```{r}
table3 = table(Robbery$Period_cat, Robbery$Day_cat_2)
xkabledply(table3, title="Contingency table 3'")
chitest3 = chisq.test(table3)

The p-value is 0.6, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis (robbery_category and day_category are independent) under the 95% confidence level. 


```{r}
table4 = table(Robbery$Period_cat, Robbery$METHOD)
xkabledply(table4, title="Contingency table4'")

Alternative hypothesis that they are not independent under the 95% confidence level.

table5 = table(Robbery$Period_cat, Robbery$Month)
xkabledply(table5, title="Contingency table 5'")
chitest5 = chisq.test(table5)
chitest5
```
The p-value is significantly less than 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis (the month and period_category are independent), we have evidence to support the 
Alternative hypothesis that they are not independent under the 95% confidence level. 


```{r}
table6 = table(Robbery$Period_cat, Robbery$DISTRICT)
xkabledply(table6, title="Contingency table 6'")
chitest6 = chisq.test(table6)
chitest6
```
The p-value is significantly less than 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis (the DISTRICT and period_category are independent), we have evidence to support the 
Alternative hypothesis that they are not independent under the 95% confidence level.
